Registration is a fundamental part of any web application, but it can be notoriously difficult to implement. In this short course, we'll create a simple and straightforward registration system that allows users to log in and log out of an application. The techniques use AngularJS and Google Firebase, a mobile development platform that makes registration easy and secure. In the process, you'll explore the basics of AngularJS MVC architecture and the steps to storing custom user information in the Firebase NoSQL database. Learn how to create basic routes to load different content depending on the target URL, and create basic controllers to tie templates to code. At the end of the course, you'll have a great template that you can use as a starting point for a registration system in any of your own web applications.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.
